1. WAP to check whether the number is Armstrong Number or Not
An Armstrong number, also known as a Narcissistic number, is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Example: 
Consider the number 153: 

• Count the number of digits: 153 has 3 digits. 
• Raise each digit to the power of the number of digits: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  
	• $1^3 = 1$ 
	• $5^3 = 125$ 
	• $3^3 = 27$ 

• Sum the results: $1 + 125 + 27 = 153$ 
• Compare the sum to the original number: Since the sum (153) is equal to the original number (153), 153 is an Armstrong number. 

Another Example: 
Consider the number 1634: 

• Count the number of digits: 1634 has 4 digits. 
• Raise each digit to the power of the number of digits: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  
	• $1^4 = 1$ 
	• $6^4 = 1296$ 
	• $3^4 = 81$ 
	• $4^4 = 256$ 

• Sum the results: $1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634$ 
• Compare the sum to the original number: Since the sum (1634) is equal to the original number (1634), 1634 is an Armstrong number.
